## My process

### Built with

- HTML 
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

While working through the project, used react hooks : useState and useEffect to display the initial state when webpage is loaded:

```js
useEffect(() => {
		fetchAdvice();
	}, [url]);
```

### Continued development

Would like to learn more about font smoothing, for this project the default font is used. In future, would like to include advices based on the categories
### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) - This helped me for adding hooks in this project. It is a part of reactjs documentation about hooks.
